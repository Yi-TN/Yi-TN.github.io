# About Me

Hi, I’m **Yuzhe Yi**, a **Game Graphics/Rendering Engineer**.

I graduated from the **University of Calgary** in June 2021 with a **B.Sc. in Computer Science (with Distinction)**. During my undergrad study, I took high level courses in **Computer Graphics, Rendering, Animation, and Games Programming**, where where I developed a deep passion for computer graphics and video games.

After graduation, I joined **CoreAVI**(now **Lynx Software Technologies**), a company specializing in **safety-critical graphics solutions** and **embedded GPUs**, as a **Software Verification Engineer**. My work involved implementing **high-level** and **unit tests** for our **Vulkan SC library** and contributing to requirements development for **OpenGL SC** and **EGL**. Through this experience, I gained a strong understanding of **modern graphics APIs**.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Master’s degree** in **Computing Science** at **University of Alberta**, specializing in **Multimedia**. My research and coursework cover **VR/AR**, **image processing**, **AI**, etc., and of course **computer graphics**.

In my spare time, I enjoy building my own **game/rendering engines**, exploring everything from **traditional rasterization pipelines** to **real-time ray tracing**. I also develop **games** and **plugins** with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**, combining my technical and creative interests to push the boundaries between art and engineering.
