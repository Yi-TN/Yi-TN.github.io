Thank you for taking the time to read my portfolio!

## My Experience

Hi, I'm **Yuzhe Yi**, a **Game Graphics/Rendering Engineer**.

I graduated from the *University of Calgary* in June 2021 with a **B.Sc. in Computer Science (with Distinction)**. During my undergrad study, I took high level courses in *Computer Graphics*, *Rendering*, *Animation,* and *Games Programming*, where where I developed a deep passion for *computer graphics* and *video games*.

After graduation, I joined **CoreAVI**, a company specializing in *safety-critical graphics solutions and embedded GPUs*, as a **Software Verification Engineer**. My work involved implementing high-level and unit tests for our **Vulkan SC** library and contributing to requirements development for **OpenGL SC** and **EGL**. Through this experience, I gained a strong understanding of *modern graphics APIs*.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Master's degree** in **Computing Science** at *University of Alberta*, specializing in *Multimedia*. My research and coursework cover *VR/AR*, *image processing*, *AI*, etc., and of course *computer graphics*.

In my spare time, I enjoy building my own **game/rendering engines**, exploring everything from *traditional rasterization pipelines* to *real-time ray tracing*. I also develop *games* and *plugins* with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine 5**, combining my technical and creative interests to push the boundaries between art and engineering.


## My Game Journey

I've been passionate about video games ever since I first picked up a *Sony PSP* as a kid. Over the years, that passion has grown into a deep appreciation for all kinds of games and the creativity behind them.

My favorite genre is **CRPGs**, especially the *Dragon Age series* and *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous*, where I experienced some of the most fascinating storytelling in games. I also enjoy Souls-like games for their challenge and design depth, I've accomplishe **all achievements** in *Elden Ring*, *Dark Souls III*, *Sekiro*, and *Bloodborne*.

I'm also a huge fan of **indie games**, such as *Hades* and *Slay the Spire*, which constantly inspire me with their creativity and unique artistic vision.

While playing, I'm always captivated by how these games bring worlds to life — from the realistic, immersive cities of *Spider-Man* and *Cyberpunk 2077* to the stylized, rhythmic energy of *Hi-Fi RUSH*. These experiences motivate me to one day contribute to the creation of games that are both visually stunning and deeply engaging, games that leave players with the same sense of wonder that first drew me into gaming.


## My Personal Life

Outside of video games, I also enjoy drawing — in fact, I created all the artwork for my game *Fuuka Student Council*!

I also have a cat, Glow, a cuddly companion who loves to sit by my side while I’m working at the computer.
