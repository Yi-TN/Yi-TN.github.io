## About Me

Hi, I'm **Yuzhe Yi**, a **Game Graphics/Rendering Engineer**.

I graduated from the *University of Calgary* in June 2021 with a **B.Sc. in Computer Science (with Distinction)**. During my undergrad study, I took high level courses in *Computer Graphics*, *Rendering*, *Animation,* and *Games Programming*, where where I developed a deep passion for *computer graphics* and *video games*.

After graduation, I joined **CoreAVI**, a company specializing in *safety-critical graphics solutions and embedded GPUs*, as a **Software Verification Engineer**. My work involved implementing high-level and unit tests for our **Vulkan SC** library and contributing to requirements development for **OpenGL SC** and **EGL**. Through this experience, I gained a strong understanding of *modern graphics APIs*.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Master's degree** in **Computing Science** at *University of Alberta*, specializing in *Multimedia*. My research and coursework cover *VR/AR*, *image processing*, *AI*, etc., and of course *computer graphics*.

In my spare time, I enjoy building my own **game/rendering engines**, exploring everything from *traditional rasterization pipelines* to *real-time ray tracing*. I also develop *games* and *plugins* with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine 5**, combining my technical and creative interests to push the boundaries between art and engineering.
