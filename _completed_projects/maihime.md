{% include feature_row %}

This game is inspired by the anime **Mai-HiME**, created for the wholesome fan community that continues to cherish and contribute art, fanfics, and passion for the series even after 20 years.

## Gameplay

Like other idle games, Fuuka Student Council is designed for relaxation and casual exploration.

Players take on the quiet role of the student council's behind-the-scenes organizer. Set out drinks and different items to attract students and other characters from Mai-HiME.

Each visit brings surprise interactions, nostalgic moments, and unique "gifts" left behind by your favorite characters. 

Designed for short, casual play sessions, Fuuka Student Council can run quietly in the background or be closed when you are away. Just check back anytime to see who visited, collect rewards, and decorate your space. Fuuka Student Council is perfect for fans who want to relax and enjoy the cozy world of Mai-HiME!

## Game Features

### Character Interactions

Featuring up to 14 characters, plus 2 secret outfits, each character interacts  with the items in the room through custom animations.

A weighted random system determines which characters appear, based on the items you’ve placed.

### Background Simulation

You don’t need to keep the game open all the time. A background simulation system calculates the time since you last played and generates visits accordingly, simulating who might have dropped by or stayed in the room while you were away.
